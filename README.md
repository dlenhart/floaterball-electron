![Floater Ball](game/assets/images/floater-ball-logo-dark.png)

A physics-based collection game where you control a white ball that floats around a grid. Collect as many squares as possible within the time 
limit. Use the walls and other objects to your advantage and get the highest score possible. P.S. don't eat the red squares!

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow Keys | Move the ball |
| Shift | Brake / stop all movement |
| Spacebar | Continue to next level |
| P | Pause / resume the game |
| Esc | Exit to main menu |

### Scoring

| Item | Points | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Gray Square | 1 point | Standard food, spawns after each piece collected |
| Green Square | 5 points | 1–3 spawn randomly per level (Level 2+) |
| Purple Square | 10 points | Bonus food that appears after 5 seconds (Level 2+) |
| Orange Square | Power-up | Doubles ball size temporarily (no points) |
| Red Square | **Game Over!** | Forbidden fruit — appears on even-numbered levels (Level 2+) |
| Gold Triangle (Sticky Mines) | **Stuck for 5s!** | Freezes your ball for 5 seconds (Level 5+) |

### Obstacles

Black obstacles start appearing at Level 2, starting at 3 and increasing by 1 each level. Use them strategically!

**Sticky Mines** (gold triangles) appear on even-numbered levels after Level 5. Rolling over one freezes your ball for 5 seconds while the timer keeps counting.

## Progression

- **50 levels** total
- Starting time: **20 seconds** per level
- Every 3 levels, the time limit decreases by 1 second (minimum 5 seconds)
- Obstacles increase each level (starting at Level 2: 3 obstacles, +1 per level)


## Building the Desktop App

```bash
./build.sh          # Build for all platforms (default)
./build.sh mac      # macOS DMG
./build.sh linux    # Linux (AppImage, deb, rpm, snap)
./build.sh win      # Windows (NSIS installer + portable exe)
```

Output is placed in the `./dist/` folder.
